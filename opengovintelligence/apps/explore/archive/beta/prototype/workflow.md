### Suggested workflow

The work<ness app is designed to help exploratory (spatial) data analysis of data relating to worklessness. The suggested workflow below will help you get the most out of the app.

**1. Find neighbourhoods with large numbers of claimants (Clusters)**    

Identify neighbourhoods at the Greater Manchester level with high numbers of claimants surrounded by neighbourhoods with similarly high levels (High-High). Then drill down into the local authority and see whether these neighbourhoods remain high. Do other neighbourhoods emerge with high claimant counts when the map is rescaled?

Check whether neighbourhoods with a large number of claimants also record high numbers of residents without qualifications or social-rented households. Is the neighbourhood also scoring high levels of deprivation? Neighbourhoods in the 1st decile are within the 10% most deprived neighbourhoods in England in 2015.

**2. Track claimant rates over time (Trends)**    

Select the ward within which your neighbourhood sits. How does the claimant rate change over the last three years? Is it rising, declining or stable?

Sort the table to see which month recorded the highest and lowest claimant rate in your ward.

Click multiple areas and compare your ward with neighbouring wards. Benchmark it against the local authority and Greater Manchester as a whole. Are rates higher, lower or similar overall? 

Download your data as a CSV and open in a spreadsheet application like Excel. Create a bar chart of the results or email the data to a colleague.

**3. Assess the reach of services (Reachability)**    
Overlay the map with Jobcentre Plus offices and zoom in on the nearest one to the neighbourhood of interest. Click the crosshairs and a polygon will be displayed showing the reach of the Jobcentre Plus office in terms of street distance or travel time. Is the office within 1 kilometre or 3 kilometres of the neighbourhood? 

Change the start location to the centre of the neighbourhood. How many food banks are within a 10 minute walk? What about GPs?
