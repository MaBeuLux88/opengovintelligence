- **Scan**: Identify hot and cold spots of worklessness across Greater Manchester. Using a technique called 'Local Indicators of Spatial Association' (Anselin, 1995) the tool identifies statistically significant spatial clusters and outliers of worklessness using claimant count and other data. The tool is aimed at analysts who are interested in the spatial distribution of worklessness.<br />

- **Signpost**: An interactive mapping app to help link workers find services that support vulnerable clients find work. Food banks, GPs and in future, complex needs support like alcohol and drug services will be shown. The included reachability tool allows users to identify the closest services to a client's home address within a specified travel time distance and the proximity of services to Jobcentre Plus locations.<br />
