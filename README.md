The [Trafford Data Lab](https://www.trafforddatalab.io) is involved in one of six pilots in the [opengovintelligence (OGI)](http://www.opengovintelligence.eu) project. The **Trafford Worklessness Pilot** aims to produce a suite of applications to visualise **Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD)**, and other open data sources, to identify areas of need and inform service delivery related to worklessness. These applications have been co-created with Jobcentre Plus staff in Stretford and council leads for worklessness across Greater Manchester. They use LOSD stored in the [GM Data Store](http://gmdatastore.org.uk), are transformed using [table2qb](https://github.com/Swirrl/table2qb) and queried using [cubiql](https://github.com/Swirrl/cubiql) which are both part of the OGI toolkit.

Work relating to the Trafford Worklessness Pilot can be found in this repo within the following folders:

- **[Apps](apps)** - suite of applications developed as the main output of the pilot
- **[Co-creation](co-creation)** - documents showing the outputs of co-creation activities
- **[Data](data)** - datasets provided as RDF data cubes converted from flat tabular CSV
- **[Dissemination](dissemination)** - resources created to highlight the work being done in the pilot
- **[Documentation](documentation)** - guides on how to use the applications and technical information regarding linked data queries in SPARQL and GraphQL
